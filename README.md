BankProject-OOP (C++)
Description

BankProject-OOP is a console-based Bank Management System developed in C++.
The project applies Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in a clear, structured, and student-friendly manner.

This project is suitable for:

University OOP courses

Academic mini-projects

Practicing clean C++ design and architecture

Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:

Simulate a real-world banking system using a console application

Apply OOP concepts correctly in a practical scenario

Maintain readable, modular, and maintainable code

Separate user interface, business logic, and data handling

Core OOP Concepts Applied

The system demonstrates the following OOP principles:

Encapsulation
Protecting data inside classes and exposing behavior through methods

Abstraction
Representing real-world entities with clear responsibilities

Inheritance
Reusing common functionality through base classes

Polymorphism
Allowing flexible behavior through shared interfaces

Separation of Concerns
Isolating UI, logic, and data layers

Main Features

The system provides core banking functionalities, including:

Client management (create, search, update, display)

Account management and operations

Deposits, withdrawals, and money transfers

Console-based menus and navigation

Data persistence using files

Architecture Overview

The project follows a layered architecture:

1. User Interface (Screens)

Responsible for:

Displaying menus and formatted output

Reading and validating user input

Navigating between screens

2. Business Logic

Responsible for:

Managing clients and accounts

Executing financial operations

Applying validation and workflow rules

3. Data Handling

Responsible for:

Saving and loading data

Maintaining system state

Organizing stored records

4. Utilities

Responsible for:

Input validation helpers

Formatting and shared functions

General reusable tools

Code Quality Principles

The project emphasizes:

Clear naming and readable code

Student-friendly C++ implementation

Modular and reusable classes

Avoiding unnecessary complexity

Easy extensibility
